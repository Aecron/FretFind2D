FretFind2D is a fretboard designer for microtonal and multi-scaled stringed instruments.
            (Oh, sure, regular guitars too. But only if you have to.)

Plans:
Fretfind is in need of a refresh. This is it. The next version will be written in javascript.
Calulation and PDF generation will take place on the client side without needing to send 
information back to the server. If you are a nerdy luthier, please join me.
