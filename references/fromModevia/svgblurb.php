<p class="heading">Uses SVG</p>
<p class="para">
The two dimensional fretboard visualization on this site is done with 
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) or Portable Network Graphics (PNG).
If you cannot see the guitar image above this paragraph, 
you will not be able to take advantage of the SVG visualizaton feature.
Adobe provides a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html">freely available SVG plug-in</a> for most platforms.
</p>
<p class="heading">Why SVG?</p>
<p class="para">
"<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/About.html">SVG</a> is a royalty-free 
vendor-neutral open standard developed under the W3C Process." 
It is XML. A plain-text format that is legible to both computers and people:
easily created with a scripting language; easily edited in a text editor.
Vector graphics, like SVG, offer precise scalable measurements. It looks good on the screen.
On paper, it makes an excellent blueprint for your designs.
