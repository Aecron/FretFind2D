	Initial Release

Mon Jul  5 02:03:56 GMT 2004
	Fixed JavaScript syntax error that prevented forms from submiting
	in Mozilla Firefox. IE allows HTML object collections to be accessed
	with tuning(i).value; Mozilla requires tuning[i].value .

	Suppressed PHP errors and warnings in fretboard.php and fretfind.php
	where they are mostlikely to be found because of bad inputs.

	Added additional explanation to the "perpendicular distance" section
	of the non-parallel frontend. Thanks to Lars Renklint for the
	feedback.

	Restructured: a separate fretboard_???.php for each format
	makes programming much cleaner. Preparing to get rid of the SVGblurb.
	Perhaps SVG isn't the perfect format though I do love it so!

	Added PDF download with FPDF
	Added DXF as a visualization choice using the fine DXF Viewer applet
	Added units for the benifit of SVG and PDF scaling

	Changed PNG scaling. PNGs are no longer scaled to 200px by 600px.
	Now they are rendered at 72dpi optionally a user can specify the dpi
	as a GET variable. Some work may need to be done on the stroke-width.

	Added multipage overlapped PDFs. I think they work quite well for 
	printing.

	Eric Belcastro reported an unexplained scale parsing error so I
	rewrote parseScala() in scala.php . The new version is much closer to
	compliant with the Scala scale file format specification. As an added 
	bonus it now dies with useful error messages when parsing bad scales.

	Fixed the scale parsing error. Hidden input couldn't deal with quotes 
	in the scale file. Textarea works fine.
